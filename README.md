Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project - SpaceX Falcon9 Launch

As part of IBM course, completed the series of analysis and predictions for successful launches of SpaceX Falcon9.

Project details: 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 
Task is to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 will land successfully!
